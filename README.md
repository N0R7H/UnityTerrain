# Unity Planetary Terrains

This system allows the creation of spherical terrains using stacked noise algorithms (Perlin, Worley etc) and heightmaps together. Heightmaps can be imported or created directly in Unity using a custom brush tool. A level of detail system was implemented and GPU accelerated algorithms (via Compute Shaders) are in development. The usage of noise algorithms allow the planets to appear extremely detailed while using very little storage (a seed is used).
